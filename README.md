### Social Network Analysis: ERGM analyses of network structure

The purpose of this project is to get experience with exponential random graph modelling of network structure, both in thinking and in practise.

**Context:**     
      
Friendship networks in school are typically highly gender segregated, highly clustered, and highly reciprocated. What is more, the corresponding actor-level “behavioural network mechanisms” of gender homophily (nominating same-gender persons as friends), reciprocation (sending friendship nominations to those people one receives one from), and transitive closure (nominating somebody as a friend who is a friend of a friend) are confounded.

Questions that are discussed in the project are:

- Why does the mechanism of gender homophily may create networks in which there is a high degree of reciprocity and transitivity, even if no explicit mechanisms of reciprocation and transitive closure operate?
- Why is the opposite not generally true, i.e., why the mechanisms of reciprocation or transitive closure do not generally create networks which are gender segregated?
